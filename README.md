## Introduction
The sample code for Golang encapsulates the server-side APIs of Push Kit, for your reference or direct use.

The following table describes packages of Golang sample code.
| Package| Description|

|examples|Sample code packages.|
|httpclient|Package for sending network requests.|
|push|Package where Push Kit server APIs are encapsulated.|

## Installation
Install the Golang environment (Golang 1.11 or later is recommended) and decompress the Golang sample code package.

Copy **org.huawei.com** in the decompressed package to the **vendor** directory in the path specified by **GOPATH** in your project. Refresh the project to ensure that the copied file exists in the directory.

## Configuration
Start configuration with the **Client** structure in the **push** package. Each method in the **Client** structure can be used to call an API of the Push Kit server.
The following table describes the method in the **Client** structure.
| Method| Description|
| ----------- | ----------- |
|SendMessage|   Sends a message to a device.|

To use the functions provided by the packages in **examples**, set related parameters in **pushcommon.go** in the common package.
